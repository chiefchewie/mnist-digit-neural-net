# neural network to recognize handwritten digits

this was a project for me to learn the basics of how neural networks work - things like neurons, activations, gradient descent, and the backpropagation algorithm

this mostly follows the very good book ![Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen
